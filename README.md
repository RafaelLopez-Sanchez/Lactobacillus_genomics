# Understanding Habitat Adaptation in the Lactobacillus Genus through Comparative Genomics

## Overview

This repository contains the data and code associated with the paper “Understanding habitat adaptation in the Lactobacillus genus through comparative genomics”. In this study, we analyze 1,020 publicly available genomes of Lactobacillus to investigate genomic differences related to habitat adaptation, radiation, or domestication processes. Lactobacillus is a key genus within the lactic acid bacteria group, widely known for its role in the food industry and health sector.

Our research explores how Lactobacillus species adapt to diverse environments, both natural (e.g., insects, vertebrates, vegetables, free-living) and artificial (e.g., dairy habitats). We employ various genomic techniques, including phylogenetic relationships, genomic distances, and gene presence/absence analysis, to better understand the strain-specific adaptive pathways within this important genus.
